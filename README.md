***********   Notes   ***********

1. According to the unixdate time, it seems the data is not captured for one hour period of time. In order to complete the questions, I will assume the data is recorded at regular intervals 60 minute. 

2. Time zone is using UTC insteand of EDT(where Pennsylvania based) as it won't afftect the result this time.

3. According to "Twenty-Four Hour Rainfall Extreme Events" (https://climate.met.psu.edu/features/rainextreme.php). The average extrame rain fall values in Pennsylvania history are about 2 - 4 inches, which about 5 - 10 cms. Based on the data provided, I assume the unit is millimeter.
